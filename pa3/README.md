# PA3

This assignment is about build the graph module to implement the depth first search(DFS) algorithm.

## Files

**List.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `List.c` 

**List.c**   
This contains the actual implementation of the `List` ADT, which will export its services to `FindComponents.c`

**Graph.h**
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `Graph.c`

**Graph.c**
This contains the struct and all the functions used for the Graph ADT

**GraphTest.c**
This contains my own test cases for all the `Graph.c` functions

**FindComponents.c**
This contains the main function that assembles the graph object and prints the strong components of `G` to the output file in topologically sorted order.

**Makefile**  
Configuration file used by the `make` utility.  

**README.md**  
Markdown file providing documentation for my project (current file)
