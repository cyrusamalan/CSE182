# CSE182
This class served as a deep dive into the world of data structures and algorithms, framed within the syntax and structures of C and C++ programming languages. It offered a rich, hands-on experience that began with building and manipulating simple linear data structures and advanced to managing complex data types and algorithms. 

PA1 introduced me to the foundational concepts of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) through the creation of an Integer List in C. This assignment not only honed my skills in memory management and modular programming but also taught me the importance of clear, organized code as I used my List ADT to alphabetize strings.

In PA2, the complexity increased as I implemented a Graph ADT. Here, the List ADT built previously was crucial in managing the Breadth-First Search algorithm. This assignment underscored the interconnectivity of data structures and the efficiency gained from leveraging them in algorithm design.

PA3 further stretched my understanding by focusing on the implementation of Depth-First Search. This was particularly enlightening in comprehending how recursive data structures and algorithms can be engineered to solve problems like identifying connected components in a graph.

PA4 was a segue into applied mathematics, where I built a calculator for matrix operations. This assignment was an eye-opener into how data structures like matrices underpin many computational problems and how optimizing operations, such as sparse matrix manipulations, is essential in computing.

PA5 shifted my perspective from structures to the algorithms operating on them. Through shuffling operations on a list, I explored the probabilistic nature of algorithms and the concept of entropy in data organization.

PA6 elevated my programming repertoire to include the Big Integer ADT, capable of handling arithmetic operations beyond the native capability of standard data types. This was a lesson in scalability and precision in algorithmic operations.

PA7 introduced me to dictionary ADTs, where I learned to manage and search through key-value pairs efficiently. This was crucial in understanding hash tables and the idea of hashing as a means of data retrieval.

Finally, PA8 consolidated my knowledge by implementing a dictionary ADT based on a Red-Black Tree. It epitomized the elegance of self-balancing trees and provided insights into the subtleties of ensuring balanced search times in a dynamically changing data structure.
