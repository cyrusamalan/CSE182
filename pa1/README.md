This assignment is about building an Integer List in C and using it to alphabetize the lines in a file

## Files

**List.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `List.c`  

**List.c**   
This contains the actual implementation of the `List` ADT, which will export its services to `Lex.c`  

**ListTest.c**  
This contains my own test cases testing the List ADT  

**Lex.c**  
File contains the main program. It uses the `List` ADT to sort the lines in a file  

**Makefile**  
Configuration file used by the `make` utility.  

**README.md**  
Markdown file providing documentation for my project (current file)
