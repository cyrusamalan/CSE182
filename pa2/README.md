# PA2

This assignment is about the implementation of the Graph ADT. Using the List ADT to build and help manage the BFS algorithm.

## Files

**List.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `List.c`  

**List.c**   
This contains the actual implementation of the `List` ADT, which will export its services to `Lex.c`  

**Graph.h**
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `Graph.c`

**Graph.c**
This contains the struct and all the functions used for the Graph ADT

**GraphTest.c**
This contains my own test cases for all the `Graph.c` functions

**FindPath.c**
This contains the main program. It will use the Graph ADT to find the shortest paths

**Makefile**  
Configuration file used by the `make` utility.  

**README.md**  
Markdown file providing documentation for my project (current file)
