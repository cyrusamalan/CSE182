This assignment uses a dictionary ADT to manage unique keys and the assocaited values. This will also read lines from an input file, but now it will be bases on Red-Black-Tree.

**Dictionary.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `Dictionary.cpp` 

**Dictionary.cpp**  
This contains the actual implementations of the ADT which will export its services for `Order.cpp` 

**DictionaryTest.cpp** 
This contains the test cases to test the dictionary ADT 

**Order.cpp**  
This contains the main funcition that will read an input file and output the corresponding values into the dictionary  

**WordFrequency.cpp**
This contains the main function that will read in each line of a file and convert everything to a lower case letter to place it as a key.  

**Makefile**  
Configuration file used by the `make` utility.  

**README.md**
