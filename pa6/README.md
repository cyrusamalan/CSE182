# PA6

This assignment will create a BigInteger ADT that will perform arithmetic operations. This involves modifiying a List ADT to store long integers, like addition, subtraction, multiplication , and using the base power.

**List.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `List.cpp`

**List.cpp**   
This contains the actual implementation of the `List` ADT, which will export its services for `BigInteger.cpp`  

**ListTest** 
This contains the test cases for the List ADT 

**Arithmetic.cpp**
This file is designed to utilize the operations exported by `BigInteger.cpp` 

**BigInteger.h**
This is the header file that will have the function prototype for `BigInteger.cpp` 

**BigInteger.cpp**
This contains the actual implementation of the the functions that will exported

**BigIntegerTest.cpp**
This file contains the test cases to make sure the implemented functions are correct  

**Makefile**  
Configuration file used by the `make` utility.  

**README.md**  
Markdown file providing documentation for my project (current file)
