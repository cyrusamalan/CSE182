# PA4

This assignment is intended to build a calculator for performing matrix operations. This is useful to learn the effeciency of large matrices with a minimal number of NNZ.

## Files

**List.h**  
This is the header file that will have all the function prototypes for `List.c` 

**List.c**   
This contains the actual implementation of the `List` ADT, which will export its services to `Sparce.c`

**ListTest.c** 
This contains the main function to test the `List.c` functions

**Matrix.h** 
This contains the function prototype for `Matrix.c`

**Matrix.c** 
This contains the actual implementation of the `Matrix` ADT, which will export its services to the test files and `Sparce.c`

**MatrixTest.c** 
This containts the main function for testing the `Matrix.c` functions

**Sparce.c** 
This contains the main function for taking w arguements and reading from one file and writing to another file
